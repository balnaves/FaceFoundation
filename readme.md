FaceFoundation is a simple AV Foundation document-based application that runs CIDetector face recognition on a real-time video playback buffer, using AVPlayerItemVideoOutput.

It is intended to be used to experiment with several ways of using the AVPlayerItemVideoOutput, initially by creating an additional CALayer for each recognised face and reframing those in real-time to follow the faces in the video.

It uses the Apple sample code AVGreenScreenPlayer as a starting point.
